FAVICON.ICO - ACTION REQUIRED
===========================================

You need to create your own favicon.ico file for your website.

HOW TO CREATE A FAVICON:
1. Use an online favicon generator (like favicon.io or realfavicongenerator.net)
2. Upload a square image (at least 256x256 pixels recommended)
3. Download the generated favicon.ico file
4. Place it in the root folder of your website (same folder as index.html)

ALTERNATIVE:
You can also create a simple favicon using:
- A free icon from icons8.com or flaticon.com
- Your logo converted to .ico format
- A simple text-based icon

The favicon.ico file should be placed in the root directory where index.html is located.
